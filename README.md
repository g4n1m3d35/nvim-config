# nvim-config

This is a setup for beginners starting with neovim

This zip contains files and plugins for the neovim configuration, inside init.vim you will have the list of plugins quite complete.

unzip the file and copy it to the .config/nvim folder, if the nvim folder does not exist, create it inside .config.

Remember to have npm and yarn installed on your machine

In the case of any problem if you want to leave a comment we will try to solve it.

Thank you
